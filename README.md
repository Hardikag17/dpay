## üßµ Our Solution

*Overview*

Any user on the web with .tez domain can easily use our platform 

Dpay‚Äôs primarily main two features are:

1. Share (pots): Users will be able to share their business's funds or birthday party funds by smoothly making joint accounts (pots) between any number of people. Just like WhatsApp groups but for sharing crypto. 

2. Send: Users will be able to send and receive cryptocurrencies to anyone with just their .tez domains.



## üí° Inspiration

These days, everyone is talking about cryptocurrencies and the Indian government accepting them is all over the news. Now, to get it accepted by the people we need to make sure that everyone can easily access them and use them for their everyday payment-related services.  Dpay does this, it brings the people and power of blockchain together. For using Dpay, people need not require any knowledge of blockchain. They can simply start using it like they use any other payment services like Gpay or PayPal. In the coming future, we are going to launch the app too.

## List of problems

- It removes the need to know each other‚Äôs wallet addresses to send crypto. Users will be able to invite people and share crypto using tezos domains

- Currently, it‚Äôs really a tedious task to share cryptocurrency with your friends and family. let's say you want your family's total crypto assets or your total business funds, your friend's birthday funds in one place, So, that they can be used by anyone among the authorized personnel whenever required, Doing this is not possible. Let‚Äôs make it flexible to share and manage all family, friends, and business funds in one place by collecting them in pots. Basically, through the Dpay platform, you can make a joint account (pot) between any number of people, and they all can easily take/send crypto to the account
